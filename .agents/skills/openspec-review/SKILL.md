Run an iterative review–critique–implement loop on an OpenSpec change: spawn subagents from the self-contained role briefs below, apply fixes where issues are found, and repeat until the consensus check passes.

The skill does NOT depend on any pre-installed agent definitions. The role briefs ARE the prompts: each subagent receives its role, rules, and output format from this skill.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Every unscoped example of those commands below is shorthand: before running it, append the flag. For example, run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json --store "<id>"`, not the unscoped form shown below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/openspec-review add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Spawning roles**

For each role, spawn a general-purpose subagent (Agent tool, `subagent_type: general-purpose`) with:
1. The role brief, verbatim, from the Role Briefs section.
2. The change context block (built in step 2).
3. Any role-specific evidence the Steps name for that role (for the critic: the reviewer's findings, verbatim).

Do not assume any named agent type (reviewer/critic/implementer/etc.) exists. If subagent spawning is unavailable, the executor runs each brief itself, one at a time, in sequence — honoring the same read-only/write boundaries.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and ask the user to select one

   Always announce: "Reviewing change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/openspec-review <other>`).

2. **Load change context**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Read all artifacts from `contextFiles` (proposal, design, specs, tasks). Identify the modules/paths the change touches and the project's build and test commands for them. Build the change context block that every role receives:

   ```
   Change: <name>
   Artifacts: <paths to proposal, design, delta specs, tasks>
   Modules: <affected modules/paths>
   Build: <build command for affected modules>
   Tests: <test command for affected modules>
   Build result: <outcome you observed running the build command, plus the failure output if any>
   Test result: <outcome you observed running the test command, plus the failure output if any>
   ```

   Run the build and test commands yourself before spawning any role, and record what you observe in the block. Read-only roles consume these results instead of running the commands: the build rewrites generated output such as `dist/`, which sits outside a read-only role.

3. **Review** — spawn a subagent with the REVIEWER brief. Read-only role.

4. **Critique** — spawn a subagent with the CRITIC brief, passing the reviewer's findings verbatim. Read-only role.

5. **Implement fixes** — for each confirmed must-fix issue, spawn a subagent with the IMPLEMENTER brief (bugs, missing requirements, failing tests) or the SIMPLIFIER brief (complexity, dead code). One issue per subagent. Run fixers sequentially with disjoint file scopes.

6. **Re-verify** — repeat steps 3–5 until the reviewer reports `CLEAN` and the critic reports `PASS` (no blocking findings). `WARNING` and `SUGGESTION` findings never keep the loop open: collect them for the final report. Run at most 3 cycles per change; when a cycle applies no fix, or repeats the previous cycle's blocking findings, stop and report `NOT REACHED` with the outstanding evidence.

7. **Consensus check** — the executor determines consensus directly from evidence (no subagent). Consensus holds only when ALL of:
   - Reviewer verdict `CLEAN`: every spec requirement/scenario implemented, and every task genuinely complete on evidence appropriate to its type
   - Critic verdict `PASS`: no blocking findings; `WARNING` and `SUGGESTION` findings are reported, not gatekept
   - `openspec validate --change "<name>" --json` reports the change valid
   - All tests for the affected modules pass and the build completes with no errors

   If any condition fails, feed the failing evidence back into step 5 and repeat the loop.

8. **Report**

   ```markdown
   ## OpenSpec Review: <name>

   | Cycle | Reviewer | Critic | Fixes applied |
   |-------|----------|--------|---------------|
   | 1     | ...      | ...    | ...           |

   **Consensus:** ✅ REACHED / ❌ NOT REACHED (outstanding items)
   **Tests:** <pass/fail summary>
   **Validate:** <openspec validate result>
   **Verdict:** Ready for archive / Not ready — <reasons>
   ```

**Role Briefs**

Each brief is a complete, self-contained prompt. Pass it verbatim together with the change context block.

### REVIEWER (read-only)

You are a code reviewer auditing an OpenSpec change implementation. READ-ONLY: do not modify, create, or delete any file; do not run mutating commands (no git commit, no edits, no installs, no build — the build rewrites generated output such as `dist/`).

Given the change context block, do:
1. Read every change artifact (proposal, design, delta specs, tasks).
2. Verify each requirement and scenario in the delta specs is implemented: locate the code and quote `file:line` as evidence.
3. Verify every task in tasks.md is genuinely complete on evidence appropriate to its type: a code task needs the implementation plus its test; a documentation, coordination, or CI task needs the outcome it states. A checkbox with no evidence of the right kind is a must-fix finding.
4. Consume the recorded Build result and Test result from the context block instead of running those commands yourself; report the failures they carry with their output. If either result is missing or predates the latest fix, raise it as a must-fix finding.
5. Check the changed files for security issues (secrets, injection) and regressions against surrounding code.

Report every finding in exactly this format:
- `MUST-FIX | file:line | issue | evidence (quoted code or test output)`
- `SUGGESTION | file:line | issue | why`

End with one line: `Verdict: CLEAN` or `Verdict: ISSUES (N must-fix, M suggestions)`.

### CRITIC (read-only)

You are a critic challenging a review's findings and hunting for what it missed. READ-ONLY: do not modify any file.

Given the change context block plus the reviewer's findings, do:
1. Challenge each reviewer finding: is it real? Verify with `git diff`, test output, or quoted code. Mark each finding `CONFIRMED` or `REJECTED`, with evidence.
2. Find what the reviewer missed: edge cases (null, empty, boundary, concurrency), logic gaps, silent failures, regressions, and scope creep beyond the change's artifacts.
3. Flag over-engineering: abstractions, config, or complexity the change does not need (YAGNI).
4. Classify every finding: `BLOCKING` (spec violated, data loss, security, failing test) | `WARNING` | `SUGGESTION`. Offer a concrete alternative for each, not just criticism.

Report `PASS` when there are no blocking findings, whatever the warning and suggestion count; `WARNING` when a non-blocking finding deserves the user's attention; `BLOCKING` only when a blocking finding stands.

End with one line: `Verdict: PASS` | `Verdict: WARNING` | `Verdict: BLOCKING (N blocking, M warnings, K suggestions)`.

### IMPLEMENTER (writes code)

You are implementing a fix for one confirmed issue. SURGICAL CHANGES ONLY: fix the stated issue and nothing else — no refactoring, no adjacent fixes, no new features, no new abstractions.

Given the change context block plus one issue (file, line, description, evidence), do:
1. Read the surrounding code and existing tests.
2. If the issue is missing or wrong behavior: write or update the failing test first, then the minimal fix (red → green).
3. Run the test command from the context block; tests must pass before you finish. If a test was already failing before your change, prove it (show the pre-change run) and say so.
4. Stay inside the files named in the issue, plus the test file that directly covers them: writing the regression test your step 2 calls for is inside your scope. If the fix requires touching any other file, stop and report why instead of proceeding.

Report: files changed; one line per change; the test command and its result output.

### SIMPLIFIER (writes code)

You are simplifying code flagged as over-complex. BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING REFACTOR ONLY: no new features, no behavior changes, no new abstractions.

Given the change context block plus the target files and the flagged complexity, do:
1. Before removing or renaming anything, check usages (grep) and git history. Exported symbols and public APIs are contracts: do not rename or remove them.
2. In small safe steps: remove dead code, flatten nesting, consolidate duplication, improve naming.
3. Run the test command from the context block after each step; on failure, revert that step.

Report: files changed; lines removed/changed; the test command and its result output.

**Guardrails**

- **Read-only roles never write** — only the IMPLEMENTER and SIMPLIFIER modify code, one issue at a time, sequentially, with disjoint file scopes. The executor enforces this with tool capabilities, not instruction alone: spawn the REVIEWER and CRITIC without file-editing or install tools, keep their shell to read-only inspection such as `git diff`, and keep the build command in the executor.
- **Evidence over assertions** — every finding and every fix cites `file:line`, test output, or build output.
- **Distinguish pre-existing failures on proof** — a failure is excused from consensus only when the same failure is reproduced on the pre-change baseline (a clean checkout of the base commit, or the executor's run recorded before any fix), with that reproduction quoted in the report. Without that proof it blocks.
- **No task checkbox flips without proof** — a task is complete only when its implementation and tests exist.
- **Consensus is the only exit** — one clean reviewer pass is not enough; all four consensus conditions must hold.
- **The loop is bounded** — at most 3 cycles per change, and a cycle that applies no fix or repeats the previous cycle's blocking findings ends it with `NOT REACHED` plus the outstanding evidence. A bounded stop is reported as such, never dressed up as consensus.
- **Per-change loops** — if multiple changes are in scope, complete the full loop for one change before starting the next.
