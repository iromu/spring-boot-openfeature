# Security Policy

## Security Updates

- **Security updates** are typically released as a patch for the latest supported version.
- We will aim to release updates as quickly as possible after a security issue has been identified and fixed.
- You can monitor the project’s releases and changelog to stay up to date with the latest security patches.

## Secure Development Practices

We follow these practices to ensure the project remains secure:

1. **Code Reviews**: All pull requests are subject to code reviews. Security concerns should be flagged during reviews.
2. **Static Analysis**: We use static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws in the codebase.
3. **Dependency Audits**: Regular audits of third-party dependencies are performed to ensure there are no known vulnerabilities.

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

If you're contributing to the project, please follow these guidelines to help maintain the security of the codebase:

1. **Do not hard-code sensitive information.**  
   Never hard-code credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information in your code. Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage secrets.

2. **Input Validation:**  
   Always validate user inputs to protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

3. **Use Secure Dependencies:**  
   Ensure that all third-party libraries and dependencies used in the project are well-maintained and do not have known vulnerabilities. Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions.

4. **Avoid Security Misconfigurations:**  
   Be mindful of misconfigurations in your development, staging, or production environments. Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed and that the environment is securely configured.

5. **Security Headers:**  
   If you're working on the web-facing portion of the project, make sure to configure security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), etc.
